The simulator has been developed using python 3.2.  It should probably
run with any python 3.x version, but will not run on python 2.x.  It
might be possible to make it run on python 2.x, but it's not a
priority at the moment.  The main issue is that the API to TkInter
changed.

If you have python 3.2 installed in your path as python3.2, you can run the
simulator by running:
./robot-sim

Otherwise the incantation is something like
python3.2 robot-sim
or
python model.py 
if python 3.2 is your default version.

TODO:  add a script to simplify startup.


One the simulator is running, you can drive manually using the buttons
at the top of the window.  

The simulator will also listen for incoming connections on TCP port
55443.  Robot software should connect to TCP port 55443 and issue
commands as described in the robot manual.

There's a test program in the test directory.  Compile it and run it -
it connects to the simulator and drives the robot.

There are a number of scenery files in the scenery directory.  Use the
"Load" button to load the scenery file - you can do this while the
robot is driving, but it's probably better to load the correct scenery
file before starting the robot software.


The native version of Tk installed on MacOS is very very slow.  Best to install activetcl:
