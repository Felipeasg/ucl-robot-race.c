RobotsProgramming
=================

We use Makefile to compile.

`make wall1` to make the wall follower.
`make wall2` to make the wall follower.
`make triangle` to make the wall follower.

and then `./go` to move the robot

Tests
=====

Tests are available only for encoders: go in `tests`, and run `make && ./test`
